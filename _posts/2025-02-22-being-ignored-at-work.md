# Why Does Being Ignored in a Remote Setup Feel So Frustrating? (And How to Fix It)

Let’s be real; working remotely across multiple offices can feel like shouting into the void at times... Your Slack messages go unanswered, your ideas are glossed over in virtual meetings, and it’s easy to feel like you’re the “out of sight, out of mind” colleague. But here’s the thing: remote work *can* work. It *has* worked extremely well for us and many others in the past. So why does being ignored still string so much, and how can we fix it?

## **Why Does It Hurt?**

1. **Am I Invisible? Why Don’t I Get an Answer?**
   When your messages or questions are ignored, it’s hard not to wonder, “Does anyone even know I’m here?” Remote work can amplify that feeling of being unseen. Being ignored leaves you in limbo. At least a “no” gives some clarity.

2. **Is It Because I’m Not in the Room? Or Is This Just a Communication Breakdown?**
   Proximity matters, even in a remote world. If decision-makers are in another office, and favour in-person communication it’s easy to feel like you’re not a priority. Is this intentional, or just chaos?

3. **Why Does It Feel Like My Input Doesn’t Matter?**
   When your ideas are overlooked, it’s hard not to think, “Do they even care what I have to say?”

4. **Are They Indifferent or Selfish?**
   When your messages or ideas are ignored, it’s natural to wonder, “Do they just not care? Or are they too focused on themselves to notice?” This can feel like a personal slight, even if it’s not intentional.

5. **Is It About Respect?**
   Being ignored can feel like a lack of respect for your time, effort, or expertise. You might think, "If they valued me, wouldn't they at least acknowledge me?"

## **But Remote Work *Can* Work**

We’ve done it before. We’ve collaborated across offices, time zones, and screens to achieve great things. The problem isn’t remote work itself—it’s how we navigate the challenges that come with it.

## **A Little Philosophy Goes a Long Way**

When frustration hits, it helps to step back and remember: you can’t control how others act, but you can control how you respond. As the Stoics would say, *“You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”* (Thanks, Marcus Aurelius.)

And if all else fails, remember Epictetus’s wisdom: *“It’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.”* Being ignored is tough, but it doesn’t define your worth or your work.

Remote work isn’t the problem—it’s how we adapt to it. Let’s focus on building better communication habits, staying visible, and remembering that we’ve made this work before. And hey, if all else fails, take a deep breath and channel your inner Stoic.

What about you? How do you handle being ignored?

## Am I Overthinking?

Sometimes, it’s not about you at all. But it’s tough not to overanalyse. "Is this a pattern, or am I reading too much into it?"
