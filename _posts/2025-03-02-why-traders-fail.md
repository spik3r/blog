# Why Trading is So Difficult: A Journey of Struggles and Losses

Trading is often seen as a quick path to wealth, but for the vast majority of traders, it’s a road paved with frustration and failure. The statistic that *90% of traders lose 90% of their money in the first 90 days* is more than just a meme; it’s a grim reality for most. In the beginning, many traders are lured by the excitement of big wins, armed with confidence and maybe a few strategies they’ve read about. However, the market is unpredictable, and even the best strategies can be derailed by emotional decision-making, poor risk management, and lack of discipline.

As the losses stack up, many traders go through a cycle of overconfidence, fear, and hope, which often leads them to chase bigger risks, compounding their downfall. It’s not uncommon for traders to blow up their accounts completely or walk away from the markets feeling defeated. In the end, trading requires more than just knowledge; it demands a deep understanding of oneself, an iron-clad mindset, and an unwavering commitment to constant learning and adaptation. For most, it’s a journey of trial, error, and eventual surrender.

## My Personal Journey

When I first started trading, I was stubborn enough to believe that I could get rich quick. I had some beginner's luck, making a few wins that convinced me I had cracked the code. But soon enough, I fell down the rabbit hole—learning more and more, adding more indicators, and trying to master every complicated technique I could find. But for every step forward, I felt like I was taking two steps back. I would overcomplicate things, adding layer upon layer of complexity, convinced that the more indicators and systems I had, the more “scientific” my approach would be.

Eventually, I realized that maybe the strategy wasn’t the problem, but the complexity was. So, I decided to simplify my approach. Now, I focus only on a few forex pairs and gold, specifically those that have trading sessions which align with my timezone. I’ve also ditched all indicators, except for volume, and I’m working to build an approach from the ground up that makes sense to me; no magic formulas or overcomplicated systems.

But the biggest lesson I’ve learned so far? It’s not the strategy that’s the real challenge; it’s the mindset. Sticking to your strategy, even when things aren’t going well, and resisting the temptation to bend the rules out of boredom, overconfidence, or a belief that you know better than the market, is where the real work lies. Mastering my own psychology is still a work in progress, but with some perseverance, I believe that someday I’ll get there.

**Relating it to Trading:**
The more we learn about trading, the more we realize how little we truly understand. It's a journey where the deeper we dive into strategies and techniques, the more we uncover just how much there is left to learn. In many cases, this expanding awareness can lead to greater losses, as we complicate our approach and lose sight of the simple truths—just like many traders, including myself, who initially lost more the more we thought we knew.

**Closing Thoughts:**
So, if you're still on this journey of learning and growth, remember that true mastery doesn't come from knowing more but from understanding the basics deeply and learning to control your emotions and mind. Have you ever found yourself losing more the more you learned? Or perhaps, are you starting to realize that simplicity and patience may be your true path forward in trading? Personally I think it applies equally to software development, and many other aspects of life?
