Ever get that itch to build *something* — but have absolutely no idea what that something is? Same here. It's like standing in Bunnings with a trolley full of tools, but no clue what you came in to build. You just know you want to build *something*.

I’ve got a terminal open with a blank buffer staring back at me like it knows I’ve got commitment issues. My hands are ready to code, but my brain’s off somewhere rewriting my LinkedIn title to “Full Stack Cloud-Native Solutioneering Evangelist” — which is wild considering I just spent 40 minutes trying to get dark mode working properly.

Do I finally want to learn Go or Rust? Should I give Haskell another go, even though I know it’ll last about as long as my meal prep phase? Or maybe it’s time to jump on the Zig trend and pretend I totally get what’s going on. Honestly, I can’t even pick a *language*, let alone a project.

It’s frustrating, because I *want* to build. I *need* to build. But the passion bit — that spark — feels like it’s on annual leave.

I dunno. Maybe it’s not about finding *the* idea, but just picking *an* idea and seeing where it goes. The Stoics reckon the only thing you truly control is yourself — not the outcome, not the hype, not whether anyone stars your repo.

So maybe the better question isn’t *“What should I build?”* but *“What’s stopping me from starting — and what does that say about me?”*
